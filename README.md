# Amazon-clone
I have made a front-end amazon website clone which is a web-app i.e can work as both website and mobile application that replicates the functionality and features of the popular e-commerce platform, Amazon. It allows users to browse and purchase products, track orders, leave reviews, and more, just like on the original Amazon website
